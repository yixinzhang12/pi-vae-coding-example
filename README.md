# pi-vae-coding-example

This repository contains coding sample for the pi-vae project. 

The ``pi_vae.py`` file contains util functions (tensor slice, permutation, etc.), all functions (nflow, affine coupling, encoding and decoding, prior and posterior calculation, reparameterization) necessary to build the pi-vae model, the pi-vae model itself, and some simulation functions featuring discrete and continuous labels. (written by author of the paper, annotated by me)

The ``vae_simulated_data_temporal_label.ipynb`` is a jupyter notebook containing testing code for discrete, continous, and temporal data simulation. (written by me)
